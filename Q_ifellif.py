#QUESTION
# BMI Calculator with Interpretations
# Add some if/elif/else statements to the BMI calculator so that it interprets the BMI values 
# calculated.

# If the bmi is under 18.5 (not including), print out "underweight"

# If the bmi is between 18.5 (including) and 25 (not including), print out "normal weight"

# If the bmi is 25 (including) or over, print out "overweight"

print("welcome to the bmi calculator!")
weight= float(input("whats your weight ?"))
height = float(input("What's your height in meters? "))

# Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)


if bmi > 18.5:
    print("underweight")
elif bmi >25 :
    print("normal weight") 
else:
    print("you are overweight")
